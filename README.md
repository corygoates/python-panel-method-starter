# python-panel-method-starter
Here's everything you need to get started on your very own panel method!

There is a video playlist on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpGzjcPNyBoAvwdh9z85TPVInAXwGuFrq) to walk you through the project. The file "instructions.pdf" lists all the formulas you need and explains some of the theory. The video playlist and the instruction document work together, so use both.

Questions? Things not clear? Bugs? Create an issue on Github or leave a comment on one of the instruction videos.
